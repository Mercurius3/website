# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# user = AdminUser.create :email => 'user@example.com', :password => 'please'
# category = Category.create name: 'Test', position: '1'
# page = Page.create name: 'Home', position: '1', slug: 'home', content: 'Dit is de home page'
event = Event.create name: 'Test', position: '1'
